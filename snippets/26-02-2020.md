Effective from January 15, 2020, the Maven Central Repository no longer supports insecure communication over plain HTTP and requires that all requests to the repository are encrypted over HTTPS. This may mean that some of your dependencies will not download (and subsequently that your projects may not build). To get around this, add the following line to your POM.


```xml
<repositories>
   <repository>
      <id>Central Maven repository</id>
      <name>Central Maven repository https</name>
      <url>https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>
```
