# To do 5/02/2020  :punch:

1. Rework the application so that it will use a database (use the LITRealty [database](https://github.com/lit-alan/advancedEAP/blob/master/resources/litrealty.sql) from Semester I) to store Agents details. 
2. Delete your existing Agent class and generate an (Agent) entity class from the Agents table in the DB.
3. All updates/deletions/insertions should now be made permanent on the DB. Consult [these notes](https://moodle.lit.ie/mod/resource/view.php?id=456722) from Semester I on using JPQL.
4. Implement [Bean Validation](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/validator/5.4/reference/en-US/html_single/#section-builtin-constraints) using built-in constraints on the Agent class. Ensure that suitable error messages appear on the view whenever a validation criteria is violated.
5. Add a dependency for the _Hibernate-validator_ to your POM.
 ```xml
 <dependency>
  <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
  <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
  <version>5.0.1.Final</version>
</dependency>
```
