1. Refactor the Agent class and add a passoword field (add a getter/setter and amend the constructor).
2. Set a password for each agent in the AgentService class.
3. Develop a form that will allow an agent to authenticate themselves to the system.
4. Add a controller method to handle the submission of the login form.
5. Develop a method in your Service class to authenticate an agent (a simple check to see if there is an entry in the list of agents 
who had an email address and password that matches the data in the request). 
6. Ensure that only authenticated agents can access any of the features you have previously built (display all agents, add and agent,
delete an agent etc).
