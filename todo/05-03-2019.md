# To do 5/03/2019  :punch:

1. Rework the application so that it will use a database (use the LITRealty database from Semester I) to store Agents details. 
2. Delete your existing Agent class and generate an (Agent) entity class from the Agents table in the DB.
3. All updates/deletions/insertions should now be made permanent on the DB.
4. Implement Bean Validation on the Agent class. Ensure that suitable error messages appear on the view whenever a validation criteria is violated.
5. Add a dependency for the Hibernate-validator to your POM.
 <dependency>
  <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
  <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
  <version>5.0.1.Final</version>
</dependency>
