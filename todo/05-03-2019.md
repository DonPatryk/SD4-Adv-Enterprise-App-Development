# To do 5/03/2019  :punch:

1. Rework the application so that it will use a database (use the LITRealty [database (https://github.com/limerickIT/SD4-Enterprise-Dev/blob/master/Assignments/Two/litrealty.sql) from Semester I) to store Agents details. 
2. Delete your existing Agent class and generate an (Agent) entity class from the Agents table in the DB.
3. All updates/deletions/insertions should now be made permanent on the DB.
4. Implement Bean Validation on the Agent class. Ensure that suitable error messages appear on the view whenever a validation criteria is violated.
5. Add a dependency for the _Hibernate-validator_ to your POM.
 ```
 <dependency>
  <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
  <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
  <version>5.0.1.Final</version>
</dependency>
```
